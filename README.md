# Ender3dent
Gonna build a Voron. Build a Trident


buy 250mm Trident BOM, leave out things you already own, like if you own 3 leadscrews then skip the leadscrew steppers
buy wire cutters and crimping tools (Microfit, JST, Ferrules)
(optional but highly recommended) buy a Trident frame and build a Trident
if you skipped no 3 then buy extrusion with a length of
2x 400mm front Z left and right
1x 330mm top Y
1x 370mm rear Z
1x 260mm top X (this can be printed)
Note this is for Ender3 None pro, with the 2040 Y extrusions, also i have not included extrusions for the bed as i use DIN rails. Basically I build mine from scraps/leftovers and there is a possibility i change my mind to a "2xEnder3 to 1xTrident" Conversion.
